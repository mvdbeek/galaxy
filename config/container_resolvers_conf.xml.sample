  <!-- <mulled /> -->
  <!-- mulled: only resolves container URI through bioconda to mulled automatic
       mapping. Should be the method of choice if mulled resolution is required
       but the container execution is handled by a container orchestration 
       instead of docker directly (ie. Galaxy has no access to a docker client 
       binary). It works of course with direct docker engine tool executions.
